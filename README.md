# MEME Art NFT contract: cw721-Heritage-System

The Heritage-System smart contract developed by [Meme Network](https://memenetwork.io), based on the [cosmwasm repo](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/master/README.md), supports [MEME Art's NFT](https://memeart.io) service on the CW-721 blockchain. cw721-Heritage-System works with all Cosmos SDK modules on the chain that support it.

# MEME Art CW-721 Heritage System

The Heritage System is a unique feature of MEME Art. It works as a family tree with a royalty structure, where the original creator and the derivative work creator are both incentivized in $MEME. The creation fee for MEME Art is 2000 $MEME, and the tokenomic distribution formula is designed to reward both the creators and the MEME Art Fund.

40% of the creation fee will be distributed to the creators, broken down as: Parent Reward 30%: When a MEME is recreated by another person, the previous parent will receive 30% of the creation fee. Origin Reward 10%: If the creator is the original creator, they will receive 10% of the creation fee as a reward.
